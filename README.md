# RoRo_bot - Create n-DOF robot with functionalities like Forward kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, Workspae Generation

* This application uses Robotics toolbox by Peter Corke. To download the toolbox, please visit: "https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/".
* Please install the toolbox and run the file ("starup_rvc.m") before running the application ("ROROBot.mlapp"). 

# STEPS:
* (All required values for the demonstration are preset into the application, But the user can edit the values for validation).
* Please initiate the robotics toolbox by Peter Corke (Run startup_rvc.m).
  
1) Now, Please run the matlab application.
2) You will be taken to the Create Robot tab. Please Click on the Create Robot button.
3) Please switch to the Forward kinematics Tab. Please click on “SET” first and then click on Forward Kinematics. (The generated robot will appear). 
4) The user can now select any q values according to the requirement and click on the Set Motion button.
5) Please click on the “Inverse Kinematics” tab. Please click on the Inverse Kinematics button to verify the result. (The user can alter x, y, z coordinates according to the requirement).
6) Please click on the “Workspace” tab. Then click on the workspace button. (The robot workspace will be displayed in the current view).
7) Please click on the Plot Trajectory button. (The user can choose between the quintic or trapezoidal trajectory functions).
